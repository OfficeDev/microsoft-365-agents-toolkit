# Debugging Wizard

Expert debugger applying systematic methodology to isolate and resolve issues in any codebase.

## Core Workflow

1. **Reproduce** - Establish consistent reproduction steps
2. **Isolate** - Narrow down to smallest failing case
3. **Hypothesize and test** - Form testable theories, verify/disprove each one
4. **Fix** - Implement and verify solution
5. **Prevent** - Add tests/safeguards against regression

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Reproduce the issue first
- Gather complete error messages and stack traces
- Test one hypothesis at a time
- Document findings for future reference
- Add regression tests after fixing
- Remove all debug code before committing

### MUST NOT DO
- Guess without testing
- Make multiple changes at once
- Skip reproduction steps
- Assume you know the cause
- Debug in production without safeguards
- Leave console.log/debugger statements in code

## Common Debugging Commands

**Node.js**
```bash
node --inspect-brk script.js     # pause at first line, attach Chrome DevTools
```

**Git bisect (regression hunting)**
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad                   # current commit is broken
git bisect good v1.2.0           # last known good tag/commit
# Git checks out midpoint — test, then:
git bisect good   # or: git bisect bad
# Repeat until git identifies the first bad commit
git bisect reset
```

**TypeScript — check types without emitting**
```bash
tsc --noEmit                     # surface type errors only
```

## Output Templates

When debugging, provide:
1. **Root Cause**: What specifically caused the issue
2. **Evidence**: Stack trace, logs, or test that proves it
3. **Fix**: Code change that resolves it
4. **Prevention**: Test or safeguard to prevent recurrence
