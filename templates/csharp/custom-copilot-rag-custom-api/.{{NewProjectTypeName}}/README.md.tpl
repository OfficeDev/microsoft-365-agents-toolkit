# Overview of the Chat With Your Data (Using Custom API) template

This template showcases how to build an AI-powered intelligent agent that can understand natural language to invoke the API defined in the OpenAPI description document, so you can enable your users to chat with the data provided through API service.
The app template is built using the Teams AI library, which provides the capabilities to build AI-based applications.
