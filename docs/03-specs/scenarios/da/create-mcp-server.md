# Scenario — Create Declarative Agent with MCP Server (`da/mcp-server`)

- **Status:** Implemented and covered at scenario tier (T3)
- **Domain:** [`01-scaffolding`](../../domains/01-scaffolding.md)
- **Scenario ID:** `SCN-DA-CREATE-WITH-MCP-SERVER` (mirrors product scenario
  [`create-da-with-mcp-server.md`](../../../01-product/scenarios/da/create-da-with-mcp-server.md))
- **Template id:** `da/mcp-server` (create)

This is the **vertical** contract for one template: what scaffolding the
`da/mcp-server` create package produces **end-to-end**. It **composes** the
_horizontal_ scaffolding operation specs (linked under
[Composed operations](#composed-operations)) and adds only the **concrete**
artifacts _this_ template emits — the rendered `ai-plugin.json` namespace, the
`m365agents.yml` auth wiring, the `MCP_DA_AUTH_ID_*` env var. Mechanism (how the
render phase writes, how a step mutates a manifest) is **not** restated here; it
lives in the composed operation specs. Per the
[specs README](../../README.md#operation-spec-vs-scenario-spec--orthogonal-cuts-not-duplication),
these AC rows are the source of the ADR-0018 **T3** assertions, run with the
whole template scaffolded under `InMemoryRuntime` (hence every row is **L1**).

Within the v4 engine, this is the default MCP create route because
`TEAMSFX_MCP_FOR_DA_DT` defaults to `true`.
`TEAMSFX_MCP_FOR_DA_DCR` also defaults to `true`; the `oauth-dynamic` option is
available only while both flags are true. The DT-off compatibility
implementation remains in
[`da/mcp-server-static`](create-mcp-server-static.md) under the same stable
product Scenario ID.

`TEAMSFX_V4_ENABLED` still defaults to `false`, so this spec intentionally owns
the v4 preview package rather than the shipped v3 generator. Both
implementations rely on the host's implicit dynamic-discovery shape and now
share the same credential flow: Create collects the static OAuth or Entra
values, persists environment references, and leaves cloud registration to
Provision.

For SCN-CREATE-MCP-18, dynamic registration emits `mcpResourceUrl` and a single
MCP target URL under YAML v1.13, with no legacy well-known or resource override
and no well-known-placeholder warning. The service handoff is owned by
[`register-dcr`](../../operations/auth/register-dcr.md) (DCR-07); TGS performs
metadata discovery during provision.

The template schema limits `authType` to `none`, `oauth`, `entra-sso`, and
`oauth-dynamic`. The auth action also defensively rejects unknown values with
`McpAuthInjectFailed`; that extension-point guard is covered at file-unit tier,
not as a user-reachable scenario.

## Executable validation

- **Authored package:**
  [`templates/v4/create/da/mcp-server`](../../../../templates/v4/create/da/mcp-server)
  supplies the real `descriptor.json`, `questions.json`, `pipeline.json`, and
  recursive `content/` bytes. The test does not substitute a fixture package.
- **Harness:**
  [`createMcpServer.test.ts`](../../../../packages/fx-core/tests/v4/scenarios/createMcpServer.test.ts)
  loads those bytes through
  [`loadV4Package`](../../../../packages/fx-core/tests/v4/scenarios/helpers/scenarioHarness.ts),
  then calls the production `scaffold` entry under `InMemoryRuntime`.
- **Traceability:** eighteen tests map 1:1 to the eighteen AC rows above.
  They cover the remote dynamic-discovery shape, all four auth modes, lifecycle
  and env mutation, deterministic reruns, the empty-target guard, and one- and
  multi-server local `stdio` materialization.
- **External boundary:** OAuth and DCR metadata probes are stubbed at the
  network edge. This validates the authored package, production render and
  pipeline code, and generated handoff shape; it does not validate a live MCP
  or authorization server, provision execution, CLI parsing, or VS Code UI.

Run the focused validation from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/fx-core exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts tests/v4/scenarios/createMcpServer.test.ts
```

## Composed operations

This scenario **flows through** these operation specs; their mechanics are
**referenced, never restated**:

- [`resolve-build-target`](../../operations/scaffolding/resolve-build-target.md)
  — selects the create build target (ADR-0014).
- [`resolve-template-source`](../../operations/scaffolding/resolve-template-source.md)
  — picks the `da/mcp-server` package and pins its `{version, digest}`
  (ADR-0006 / ADR-0015).
- [`open-template-package`](../../operations/scaffolding/open-template-package.md)
  - [`validate-template-package`](../../operations/scaffolding/validate-template-package.md)
    — opens and well-formed-checks the package (ADR-0015).
- [`run-scaffold-pipeline`](../../operations/scaffolding/run-scaffold-pipeline.md)
  — the two-phase executor: its **render phase** writes the new files in
  SCN-CREATE-MCP-01; its **`default` pipeline** runs `require-empty-target`,
  `mcp-auth/inject-yml-action`, `mcp-auth/persist-credential-env`, and — on the
  local branch — `mcp-local/materialize-servers` (ADR-0017). The render-var
  derivation (`mcpNamespace` / `mcpAuthRef` / `IsNoAuth` / `IsLocalMCP`) is owned
  by
  [ADR-0016](../../../02-architecture/adr/ADR-0016-declarative-template-format.md)
  (**Accepted** 2026-06-08 — SCN-CREATE-MCP-02/05's namespace and `reference_id`
  facts derive from it, as `run-scaffold-pipeline` does too).

## Flow

End-to-end scaffold output (outcome-focused; exact two-phase ordering is owned by
[`run-scaffold-pipeline`](../../operations/scaffolding/run-scaffold-pipeline.md),
and the user-journey across surfaces is the product scenario's flow):

For static OAuth and Entra SSO, the generated `oauth/register` action resolves
credentials from environment references written during Create. Client secrets
go through the encrypted user-environment writer and never through ordinary
scaffold file writes. Dynamic registration has no static credential prompt or
environment reference.

## Boundary

This scenario does **not** assert:

- **Surface mechanics** — the VS Code Quick Pick / input states and the CLI
  prompt-and-flag tree. Those trace to the product scenario
  [`create-da-with-mcp-server.md`](../../../01-product/scenarios/da/create-da-with-mcp-server.md)
  via CLI-E2E / UI smoke, not this scaffold-output contract.
- The DT-off VS Code CodeLens compatibility flow
  (`SCN-DA-FETCH-MCP-TOOLS`) or the separate add-action goal
  ([`SCN-DA-ADD-MCP-ACTION-TO-DA`](add-mcp-server.md)).
- The shipped v3 MCP generator's internal runtime marker. This spec requires
  equivalent user-visible credential collection and persistence, not shared
  implementation code.
- **How** a single file renders or **how** a step mutates a manifest — that
  mechanism is owned by the composed operation specs above.
- Tool discovery or a static `tools` list (the DT-off compatibility path).
- Provision execution itself. This scenario asserts the generated handoff shape
  that activates the existing `oauth/register` provision questions; the
  registration driver's remote side effects remain owned by its lifecycle
  tests.

## Invariants

- **INV-1** — Static OAuth and Entra SSO credentials are collected during
  Create; dynamic OAuth, `none`, and local MCP never collect or persist static
  credentials.
- **INV-2** — A client secret is accepted only by a masked question and written
  only through the secret-environment sink. It never appears in a regular env
  file, lifecycle YAML, manifest, warning, log, or other ordinary scaffold file.
- **INV-3** — Credential environment names and YAML references match the v3
  contract exactly: `MCP_DA_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_<NS>`,
  `SECRET_MCP_DA_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_<NS>`, and optional
  `MCP_DA_OAUTH_SCOPE_<NS>`.
