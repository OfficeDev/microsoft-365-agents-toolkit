# Architecture

Engine-neutral architecture documents for the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit. This
folder answers a single question:

> *"How is the engine itself built — what shape must any new piece of code fit
> into, and what cross-cutting contracts does it have to honor?"*

Architecture is engine-internal: it describes the toolkit's own codebase. The
external substrate it binds to (identity, service endpoints, registered app
metadata) is captured as fact pages under
[`external-dependencies/`](external-dependencies/README.md) — those facts feed
*into* architecture decisions but are not themselves architectural choices.
Business behavior — what a feature does from the user's point of view — lives
in [`docs/01-product/`](../01-product/README.md) and is contracted in
[`docs/03-specs/`](../03-specs/README.md).

## What lives here

Three kinds of content, in this order:

1. **Chosen structure** — package boundaries, layering, dependency direction,
   composition rules, lifecycle composition. The deliberate shape of the engine.
2. **Cross-cutting contracts** — error model, logging / telemetry boundary,
   configuration model, context propagation, public vs internal API surface, i18n.
   Things every package must agree on for the engine to work as one system.
3. **Resulting constraints** — rules new code must follow because of (1) and (2)
   (e.g. "no cross-package internal imports", "no new module-scoped runtime
   state"). Constraints are the *output* of architectural decisions, not the
   definition of architecture.

Binding decisions are recorded as **ADRs** (numbered, dated, immutable). Every
constraint in this folder should be traceable to an ADR that explains *why*.

## What does NOT live here

- Per-feature behavior, AC tables, operation specs, scenario specs — [`docs/03-specs/`](../03-specs/README.md).
- Product intent, scenarios, surface UX — [`docs/01-product/`](../01-product/README.md).
- Per-package coding conventions (file headers, lint rules, naming) — [`.github/instructions/`](../../.github/instructions/).

## Subfolders

- [`adr/`](adr/README.md) — numbered, dated, immutable architectural decisions.
- [`external-dependencies/`](external-dependencies/README.md) — fact pages for the
  external substrate the toolkit binds to (first-party AAD app, broker,
  sovereign clouds, service endpoints). Inputs to architecture decisions, not
  decisions themselves.

## Topic pages

Engine-internal subsystem topic pages live at the root of this folder. Each
topic page lists the subsystem's essential capabilities and cross-cutting
properties, links to the relevant fact pages for the upstream contracts it
binds to, and links to `Proposed` ADRs for any open structural questions.
Topic pages have up to two siblings:

- `<topic>.code-map.md` — navigation aid mapping each capability / property
  to current source; not part of the contract; expected to churn.
- `<topic>.current-state.md` — *optional*, time-bound. Observed costs of
  the current implementation, organized to inform ADR proposals and to
  give AI agents a written floor of context. Not a contract, not a
  decision, not a navigation aid. Carries an `Expires-when:` header (see
  [Conventions](#conventions)) and is rewritten or deleted once that
  condition is met. Add one only when (a) the subsystem has open
  structural questions being worked through ADRs and (b) those ADRs
  share a common backdrop worth writing down once rather than restating
  in every ADR's Context section.

| Topic | Page | Code map | Current state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scaffolding subsystem (create / import → on-disk project skeleton) | [`scaffolding.md`](scaffolding.md) | [`scaffolding.code-map.md`](scaffolding.code-map.md) | [`scaffolding.current-state.md`](scaffolding.current-state.md) |

## Conventions

- ADRs are Markdown, English, numbered sequentially, and never edited after they
  are accepted. To change an accepted decision, add a new ADR whose status is
  `Accepted` and update the old one's status to `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
- **Single source of truth.** A fact lives in exactly one page; every other page
  links to its owner rather than restating it. Architecture pages reference ADRs
  by number rather than restating them; the same rule holds between any two
  pages. Restating a fact that already has an owner is a review reject.
- **Time-bound pages carry an `Expires-when:` header.** Any page meant to die —
  a `*.current-state.md` assessment, an ADR-decomposition *proposal* — opens with
  a blockquote naming its death condition: the ADR ids (or a link to the section
  listing them) whose all-`Accepted` state retires the page, plus any human
  clause that is not machine-checkable (for example, **Expires-when:** ADR-0014 –
  ADR-0019 all `Accepted`). CI flags such a page (soft, not a hard fail) once its
  listed ADRs are all `Accepted`, prompting a human to collapse it to a pointer
  or delete it. A time-bound page without this header is a review reject.
- Specific architectural choices (e.g. composition pattern, error type, registry
  vs class hierarchy) belong in ADRs, not in this README — this page is a
  contents page, not a decision log.

## Status

ADRs live under [`adr/`](adr/README.md). Open backlog items (status
`Proposed`) are seeded from open questions on
[`external-dependencies/`](external-dependencies/README.md) fact pages and
from open structural questions on the topic pages above. This folder is
being populated incrementally; topic pages and ADRs together are the
authoritative source as they land.
