# Scaffolding subsystem — v4 create flow proposal

> **Expires-when:** ADR-0014 – ADR-0019 all `Accepted` (already met as of 2026-06-08).

- **Status:** Decomposed — superseded by **ADR-0014 … ADR-0019** (all `Accepted`
  2026-06-08). This file is now a short navigation pointer.
- **Date:** 2026-05-28 (decomposed 2026-06-08)
- **Scope:** the `create` lifecycle — from a user-confirmed "new project" intent
  to a generated project folder on disk.
- **Companion:** [`scaffolding.current-state.md`](scaffolding.current-state.md)
  (the pain catalog this addressed) and
  [`scaffolding.backlog.md`](scaffolding.backlog.md) (the open
  in-place-modification / VS backlog, relocated from the former §13).

> **What happened to the body.** This proposal carried the full v4 create-flow
> design (former §§1–15) through 2026-06-08, validated against the two on-disk
> worked examples under `v4/{create,modify}/`. It has now been
> **decomposed** into six focused, `Accepted`, immutable ADRs and their derived
> specs under [`docs/03-specs/`](../03-specs/README.md). The full prose is in
> git history; the **binding contract** is the ADRs and specs. This file remains
> only as the **decomposition map** (so inbound `proposal §N` references still
> resolve) plus the advisory rollout note (§15). Revisiting any decision requires
> a **superseding ADR**, not an edit here.

## Decomposition map

Each former section cluster, the decision it became, and the spec(s) derived
from that decision. Inbound "`scaffolding.create.proposal.md` §N" links (from
ADR `Source` lines and spec `Seam` lines) resolve here.

| §5.2 | [ADR-0006](adr/ADR-0006-template-distribution-channel.md) — Template distribution channel. **Not** decomposed from this proposal; the two share only the `(package-source, package-version)` hand-off and the `descriptor.minEngineVersion` compatibility check | [`resolve-template-source`](../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/resolve-template-source.md) · [`open-template-package`](../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/open-template-package.md) |
| §13 | Open `modify` / Visual-Studio backlog — **not yet decomposed** | → [`scaffolding.backlog.md`](scaffolding.backlog.md) |
| §§11, 12 | Worked example (`da/mcp-server`) + rationale — advisory | folded into the ADR-0018 scenario specs above |

The full domain index (every operation + scenario spec) lives in
[`docs/03-specs/domains/01-scaffolding.md`](../03-specs/domains/01-scaffolding.md).

## 14. ADRs this proposal will be decomposed into

This proposal became the Context for six focused ADRs, **all now `Accepted`
(2026-06-08)** — see the decomposition map above for each one's sections and
derived specs:

- [ADR-0014](adr/ADR-0014-dispatcher-buildtarget-resolution.md) — Dispatcher with `BuildTarget` (`{ templateId, language? }`) resolution as the front stage.
- [ADR-0015](adr/ADR-0015-templates-version-artifact-shape.md) — `templates-v4@version` release artifact shape.
- [ADR-0016](adr/ADR-0016-declarative-template-format.md) — Declarative descriptor + questions + replaceMap, with the single closed expression grammar.
- [ADR-0017](adr/ADR-0017-named-pipeline-step-whitelist.md) — Named pipeline + step / actionTemplate whitelist + domain-typed step naming.
- [ADR-0018](adr/ADR-0018-scaffold-runtime-test-pyramid.md) — `ScaffoldRuntime` + T1/T2/T3 pyramid + design-first `descriptor.spec` gate (the v4-scaffolding *application* of the Accepted [ADR-0013](adr/ADR-0013-test-tiering-and-coverage-gate.md), not a competing tiering).
- [ADR-0019](adr/ADR-0019-dual-stream-scaffold-telemetry.md) — Dual-stream telemetry, joined by `correlation-id`; no v3-event deprecation in scope.

Two boundary facts the six-ADR set deliberately does **not** turn into new
decisions:

- **Invariant 14 (network-use parity)** is not owned by any of the six. It binds
  the offline-by-default property in [`scaffolding.md`](scaffolding.md) §3.2 to
  the per-template `descriptor.requiresNetwork` flag — a prose policy turned into
  a discoverable, statically-checkable flag, not an ADR-level decision. The set
  covers invariants 1–13, 15, 16, 17.
- **[ADR-0006](adr/ADR-0006-template-distribution-channel.md)** (distribution
  channel) is separate: v4's single-package shape settles the content / metadata
  half of that cluster by construction (an ADR-0015 consequence), while channel /
  source / version resolution remains ADR-0006's.

## 15. Feasibility & rollout (advisory)

Retained because no ADR owns it — the advisory reasoning behind sequencing the
implementation. The ADRs own the binding decisions; this is guidance only.

- **Already de-risked.** No mechanism is a novel bet: the adapter bridge reuses
  [`IGenerator`](../../packages/api/src/generator.ts) (today's v3 generators
  already implement it); `ScaffoldRuntime` is DI of `fs / http / archive / clock
  / binaryCache` (the last returns `Result` per the neverthrow rule); declarative
  JSON-under-schema matches existing manifest-package usage; whitelist dispatch +
  load-time validation is a net reduction in branching over v3 string switches.
- **The one unknown — three static analysers.** `produces` forward-reference
  checking (invariant 7), proving a `requiresNetwork: false` template never
  reaches `runtime.http` (invariant 14), and `condition` reachability against the
  selector + optionsSchema graph (invariant 16). The likely resolution for 14:
  providers/steps **declare** their runtime-face use in the registry entry and
  the analyser checks the declaration rather than reverse-engineering the body.
  All three are CI-warn (soft) to absorb early imprecision. **A spike on these is
  the recommended first de-risking step before ADR-0018 binds in code.**
- **Recommended rollout — tracer bullet, not full whitelist.** (1) Spike the
  three analysers; (2) drive `da/mcp-server` end-to-end as the **first vertical
  slice** with the *minimum* loader / runtime / step / provider set it needs —
  asserted against [`scenarios/da/create-mcp-server.md`](../03-specs/scenarios/da/create-mcp-server.md);
  (3) only then backfill the remaining step / provider / `expr` whitelist entries
  as subsequent templates migrate. This keeps the first end-to-end scenario test
  the proof of the shape and makes every later template a marginal-cost data
  change.
- **Standing post-acceptance risks to govern** (named here, not blockers): whitelist
  growth turning "data PR" back into "code PR" (signal: growth rate per release);
  static-analyser imprecision (signal: CI false-positive/negative rate); a DSL
  expressivity gap forcing logic back into code (signal: migrations blocked on
  missing DSL forms — needs 2–3 real templates to confirm coverage); and
  `minEngineVersion` user friction on older engines (a deliberate ADR-0015 trade,
  surfaced as an explicit upgrade error).
