# ADR-0014 — Dispatcher + BuildTarget resolution as the scaffolding front stage

- **Status:** Accepted (Amended 2026-06-15 — see Amendments 1–2)
- **Date:** 2026-05-28 (Accepted 2026-06-05; Amended 2026-06-15)
- **Source:** [`scaffolding.create.proposal.md` §14](../scaffolding.create.proposal.md#14-adrs-this-proposal-will-be-decomposed-into)
  (decomposes §§5, 5.1, 5.3, 9, 9.1, 10; invariants 12, 17). Validated against
  the on-disk `templates/v4/create/selector.json` and
  `templates/v4/modify/selector.json` plus `templates/v4/schema/selector.schema.json`.

## Context

This is an **internal** decision (composition pattern + module boundary), not
one forced by an external tool. The v3 create flow resolves "which starter,
which language, which generator" through `templateNames.ts` +
`question/create.ts` + per-capability `generator/*.ts` + `onDidSelection`
branches — routing is code, scattered, and an AI agent editing it can reach the
engine by accident (`scaffolding.current-state.md`).

The proposal's §§5/9 replace that with a single **front stage** that resolves a
**BuildTarget** (`{ templateId, language? }`) before any generator runs, fed by
a per-kind declarative `selector.json`. The two shipped selectors
(`create/selector.json`, `modify/selector.json`) are the ground truth this ADR
ratifies: routing is data under [`selector.schema.json`](../../../templates/v4/schema/selector.schema.json),
and v3 and v4 coexist behind it.

## Options considered

- **A — Keep code-based routing (`templateNames` + `onDidSelection`).** Zero
  migration, but the current-state pain (engine-reachable-by-accident,
  untestable routing) persists and AI edits stay unsafe.
- **B — One global selector tree for both create and modify.** Fewer files, but
  conflates two disjoint `templateId` namespaces and breaks the per-kind
  overlap check; modify's increment tree and create's project-type tree have no
  shared root.
- **C — Per-kind declarative `selector.json` resolving a BuildTarget, four
  route engines, v3/v4 coexistence (chosen).** Routing is data; each kind owns
  its tree; the engine carries no per-option side-effect `if`.

## Decision

1. **The dispatcher front stage resolves a `templateId` — and only a
   `templateId`** — from three sources (§9): (A) an interactive `selector.json`
   route, (B) an external direct `templateId` (`atk add action
   --api-plugin-type mcp`, CodeLens), (C) a non-interactive batch-flag route
   fed to the same §5.3 route predicate. **(Amended 2026-06-15 — Amendment 1:
   sources A and C are unified into one prefill-aware `walk` source. Amendment 2:
   source B (`direct`) is also withdrawn — `atk add` / CodeLens / modify are
   pre-filled walks over the kind's `selector.json` — leaving a single `walk`
   source; the route predicate and the `templateId`-only output are unchanged.)**
   **`dispatch` keys off `templateId` only** — it never reads `descriptor.languages` and never branches on
   language (the v3/v4 registry choice is a function of `templateId` alone).

   `language` is a **separate BuildTarget axis**, not part of route resolution.
   It is resolved by the stage that already holds the chosen template's
   `descriptor` (descriptor-bound, not dispatcher-bound), anywhere inside the
   window **[templateId/descriptor resolved] .. [before `content/{language}/`
   render]**: its legal values are bounded by `descriptor.languages`, it is
   auto-skipped when that lists a single language (both MCP scenarios:
   `"languages": ["common"]`), and the exact prompt position inside the window
   (immediately after routing, or deferred past Q2) is a surface/UX choice, not
   an engine contract. The resulting `BuildTarget = { templateId, language? }`
   feeds the rest of the flow (Q2 → pipeline / v3 generator), which is identical
   regardless of source. This keeps `resolveBuildTarget` a pure route
   resolver — a caller-supplied `language` (Source B/C) rides along untouched;
   only the interactive surface prompts for it, and only after a descriptor is
   in hand. **(Amended 2026-06-15 — Amendment 2: `language` leaves `BuildTarget`
   entirely and is resolved as the Q0 `language` question (ADR-0016 decision 5)
   in the collect-inputs walk; `resolveBuildTarget` no longer reads
   `descriptor.languages` and binds no language axis.)**

2. **Each `selector.json` route declares its `engine`** — the closed set is
   `{ v4, v3, v3-core-method, surface-action }` (invariant 12,
   `selector.schema.json`):
   - `v4` → load `templates/v4/<kind>/<templateId>/{descriptor,questions,pipeline}`
     and run the v4 path (e.g. `da/mcp-server`).
   - `v3` → the composition-root glue (§5.1) calls the named `v3Adapter`
     generator with collected Q1 inputs; the v4 engine is not involved.
   - `v3-core-method` → the modify seam: the route names a shipped `coreMethod`
     (e.g. `addPlugin`), invoked with Q1 inputs. Used where the post-create path
     is a core method/driver, not an `IGenerator`. The `modify` selector's
     non-DT MCP route (`add-action ∧ mcp ∧ ¬DT → addPlugin`) uses it.
   - `surface-action` → scaffolds nothing; names an `action` the surface maps to
     a command (the declarative form of today's `start-with-github-copilot`
     special case).

3. **v3 and v4 are two separate worlds joined only at the composition root**
   (§5.1, §10). The v3 generator registry and v3 core-method registry are
   **frozen** allow-lists; v4 routing is **descriptor-derived** (§5.3) — the
   create selector's routable v4 ids are exactly the `templates/v4/create/*`
   descriptors, not a hand-maintained index. Templates migrate v3→v4 one route
   at a time by flipping a single route's `engine`.

4. **CLI keeps back-compat aliases** (§9.1): `--template-id` is the v4 primitive
   (Source B); `--capability` / `--language` remain as aliases the dispatcher
   resolves into a BuildTarget, so existing scripts keep working. **(Amended
   2026-06-15 — Amendment 2: with the `direct` source gone, the `--template-id`
   primitive is withdrawn; the CLI's primary flags are the neutral dimension
   flags derived from `selector.json` (`derive-cli-options`), and `--capability`
   / `--language` remain as aliases onto those dimensions.)**

## Consequences

- **New constraint (invariant 12):** every `routes[].engine` must be one of the
  four values, with the engine-specific required key present (`templateId` /
  `v3Adapter` / `coreMethod` / `action`) and the other branches' keys forbidden.
  Enforced by `selector.schema.json` + a loader check.
- **New constraint (invariant 17):** v4 routing ids must resolve to an existing
  `templates/v4/<kind>/<id>/descriptor.json`; a route to a missing descriptor is
  a build failure (routing is derived, not hand-listed).
- **Per-kind overlap check:** `create/` and `modify/` each own a
  `selector.json`; the §5 enumerable-route overlap check runs per-kind over
  disjoint `templateId` namespaces.
- **Shares one hand-off with [ADR-0006](ADR-0006-template-distribution-channel.md)**
  (`(package-source, package-version)` + `descriptor.minEngineVersion`) and one
  with [ADR-0015](ADR-0015-templates-version-artifact-shape.md) (the
  `templateId → on-disk package` locator). It does **not** decide the
  distribution channel.
- **Reversible while `Proposed`:** ratification (flip to `Accepted`) is the
  owner's call; until then the route-engine set and source model may still
  change. The two shipped selectors are the conformance fixtures.

## Derived specs

- [`resolve-build-target`](../../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/resolve-build-target.md)
  — the operation spec that turns this decision into an AC-tabled behavioral
  contract (route resolution → `templateId`, dispatch; **per Amendment 2 the
  `language` axis moved to
  [`collect-create-inputs`](../../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/collect-create-inputs.md)**,
  the Q0 `language` question bound against
  [ADR-0016](ADR-0016-declarative-template-format.md) decision 5).

## Amendment 1 — Unify the interactive + non-interactive sources (2026-06-15)

- **Status:** Accepted (in-place amendment; the Decision above is otherwise
  unchanged).
- **Scope:** Decision 1's *source model* only. `dispatch` keying off
  `templateId` (Decision 1), the closed `engine` set (Decision 2), v3/v4
  coexistence (Decision 3), the CLI back-compat aliases (Decision 4), and the
  descriptor-bound `language` axis are all untouched.

### Why

The original three sources split the *interactive* walk (A) and the
*non-interactive* batch (C) into two code paths even though both end in the
identical §5.3 route predicate. The "a pre-filled answer is used as-is, never
prompted" rule already governs Q2 ([`collect-create-inputs`](../../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/collect-create-inputs.md)
INPUT-12) and the v3 question visitor; modeling A and C as two sources just
duplicated that rule at Q1.

### Decision

`resolveBuildTarget` takes **two** sources, not three:

- **`walk`** — the prefill-aware Q1 walk. For each gated question (its
  `condition` evaluated over the answers collected so far): a **pre-filled**
  answer is used as-is and the prompt is skipped; otherwise, when
  **interactive**, the answer is prompted; otherwise (**non-interactive**, no
  pre-fill) it is an explicit `UserError` naming the missing required dimension
  (never a silent `no-matching-route`). The old interactive source is `walk`
  with no pre-fill; the old batch source is `walk` with the dimension flags
  pre-filled and `interactive=false`.
- **`direct`** — unchanged (Source B): a caller-supplied `templateId` skips the
  selector entirely.

The `language` axis follows the same rule: a multi-language template with no
caller `language` is prompted when interactive, and an explicit `UserError` when
not — it no longer assumes a prompt is reachable.

### CLI vocabulary

The pre-fill keys are the selector's own neutral dimension names (`projectType`
/ `daTemplate` / `actionSource` / …). The CLI's primary flags are derived from
`selector.json` (the new
[`derive-cli-options`](../../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/derive-cli-options.md)
spec), and the Decision 4 `--capability` / `--language` aliases resolve onto
those neutral dimensions. There is still no second (CLI-side) routing table.

### Derived-spec impact

[`resolve-build-target`](../../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/resolve-build-target.md)
(the `ResolveEntry` shape, the `walk` AC rows, INV-3),
[`walk-create-selector`](../../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/walk-create-selector.md)
(the `prefilled` + `interactive` inputs and the missing-dimension AC), and the
new `derive-cli-options` realize this amendment. No other ADR-0014 consequence
changes.

## Amendment 2 — Collapse to a single `walk` source; `language` moves to collect-inputs (2026-06-15)

- **Status:** Accepted (in-place amendment; supersedes the `direct` source
  retained in Amendment 1 and the dispatcher-bound `language` axis in Decision 1).
- **Scope:** Decision 1's *source model* and *`language` placement* only.
  Dispatch keying off `templateId` (Decision 1), the closed `engine` set
  (Decision 2), and v3/v4 coexistence (Decision 3) are untouched. Decision 4's
  `--template-id` primitive is withdrawn (it was the CLI face of the removed
  `direct` source); its `--capability` / `--language` aliases and the neutral
  dimension flags (`derive-cli-options`) remain.

### Why

Amendment 1 reduced three sources to two (`walk` + `direct`). The remaining
`direct` source — a caller handing a bare `templateId` — has **no live
producer**: every realistic entry (create, `atk add`, CodeLens, modify) holds
**dimensions**, not a `templateId`, and the per-kind `selector.json` routes
those dimensions to the `templateId`. The two shipped selectors prove it —
`create/selector.json` and `modify/selector.json` each carry the kind's
dimension tree (e.g. modify's `addCapability` → `actionSource` → `add-mcp-server`).
`atk add action --api-plugin-type mcp` is therefore a **pre-filled walk over the
modify selector**, not a `direct` `templateId`. The only literal-`templateId`
entry was CLI `--template-id`, which `derive-cli-options` removes in favour of
neutral dimension flags.

Symmetrically, `language` was resolved **inside** `resolveBuildTarget` (the
post-dispatch language bind) even though Decision 1 already declared it
descriptor-bound and free to resolve "anywhere in the window … past Q2." Its
legal values are exactly `descriptor.languages` — i.e. it is the **options
source for the Q0 `language` question** collect-inputs already owns (ADR-0016
decision 5, INPUT-13; auto-skipped when that lists a single language — both MCP
scenarios are `["common"]`). Resolving it at Q1 forced `resolveBuildTarget` to
read `descriptorLanguages` and own a prompt that is really collect-inputs' job.

### Decision

`resolveBuildTarget` takes **one** source, not two:

- **`walk`** (the only source) — the prefill-aware Q1 walk over the kind's
  `selector.json` (create / modify), exactly as Amendment 1 defines it. It
  outputs `{ templateId, engine }` plus the walked dimension `answers`; a caller
  that already knows the answer simply pre-fills the dimensions (used-as-is,
  never prompted) — the one mechanism for `atk add` / CodeLens / a CLI batch.
  There is no `direct` entry and no registry-only dispatch path; the route
  declares the `engine`. (A future API that truly holds a bare `templateId` can
  dispatch by registry in a thin helper *outside* `resolveBuildTarget`, never as
  a second entry into it.)

- **`language` moves to collect-inputs.** It is no longer a `BuildTarget` field.
  After routing yields a `templateId`, the chosen package's
  `descriptor.languages` is the option range of the Q0 `language` question
  (ADR-0016 decision 5) in the collect-inputs walk — pre-filled
  (`--language` / caller) ⇒ used as-is and bounds-checked, single-language ⇒
  auto-skipped, multi-language interactive ⇒ prompted, multi-language
  non-interactive without a value ⇒ the same missing-dimension `UserError` the
  walk raises for any required dimension. `BuildTarget` is now
  `{ templateId, engine, answers? }`; the scaffolder reads `language` from the
  collected answers.

The resolver is now a pure router, and exactly **one** prefill-aware walk
primitive is shared by Q1 (selector) and Q2/Q3 (collect-inputs, including the
language question).

### Derived-spec impact

[`resolve-build-target`](../../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/resolve-build-target.md)
(drop the `direct` half of `ResolveEntry` → a single walk input; remove the
`language` / language-bind AC rows and the `descriptorLanguages` port face),
[`collect-create-inputs`](../../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/collect-create-inputs.md)
(already owns the Q0 `language` question — ADR-0016 decision 5 — that now binds
the whole language axis: options from `descriptor.languages`, `skipSingleOption`,
the missing-dimension rule),
[`walk-create-selector`](../../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/walk-create-selector.md)
(the same walk now also drives `modify`), and
[`derive-cli-options`](../../03-specs/operations/scaffolding/derive-cli-options.md)
(the `--template-id` primitive is gone; the language flag stays the generic
`programming-language` option, DCO-03). No other ADR-0014 consequence changes.
